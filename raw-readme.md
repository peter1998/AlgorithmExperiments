## üìö Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive set of experiments and visualizations for understanding fundamental algorithm concepts. The current implementation focuses on exploring binary search and Big O notation from Chapter 1 of "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava.

### What's inside?

- ‚úÖ **Interactive binary search algorithm** implementation with step tracking
- ‚úÖ **Visual complexity analysis** of various algorithms
- ‚úÖ **Phone book simulation** demonstrating practical applications
- ‚úÖ **Big O cheat sheet** that brings theory to life

## üîç Key Concepts Explored

### 1. Binary Search

Binary search is a fundamental divide-and-conquer algorithm used to find an item in a sorted list. The repository includes both iterative and recursive implementations with detailed step counts to demonstrate the logarithmic complexity.

```python
# Binary search with step counting
def binary_search(sorted_list, item):
    low = 0
    high = len(sorted_list) - 1
    steps = 0
    
    while low <= high:
        steps += 1
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        guess = sorted_list[mid]
        
        if guess == item:
            return mid, steps
        elif guess > item:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
            
    return -1, steps
```

### 2. Big O Notation Analysis

The repository explores various time complexities:

- **O(log n)** - Binary search operations
- **O(n)** - Linear search operations
- **O(n¬≤)**, **O(n log n)**, etc. - Visualization of other complexities

### 3. Questions Addressed

#### Problem 1.1 & 1.2: Maximum Steps in Binary Search
- For a sorted list of 128 names: maximum of 8 steps
- For a sorted list of 256 names: maximum of 9 steps

#### Problems 1.3-1.6: Big O Notation
- Finding a phone number by name in a phone book: O(log n)
- Finding a name by phone number: O(n)
- Reading all entries in a phone book: O(n)
- Reading just entries starting with a specific letter: O(n)

The repository includes visualizations that demonstrate these concepts empirically.

## üìà Key Findings

The experimental results clearly demonstrate the following:

1. **Binary search achieves O(log n) complexity:**
   - For a list with 1024 elements, only 11 steps are needed
   - Recursive and iterative implementations show identical performance

2. **Phone Book operations confirm theoretical complexities:**
   - Name search (binary search): O(log n) - Extremely efficient as dataset grows
   - Number search (linear search): O(n) - Performance degrades linearly with dataset size
   - Full data reading: O(n) - Scale directly with input size

3. **Real-world implications:**
   - Logarithmic algorithms remain efficient even with extremely large datasets
   - Linear algorithms become impractical with very large datasets
   - Data structure selection dramatically impacts application performance
